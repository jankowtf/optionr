Description: The package provides an extendable interface to conventiently
    create customized project and package options. The package allows to
    specify and retrieve options based on path-like names/identifiers (e.g.
    `output/type/pdf = TRUE` will be translated into the following nested
    environment structure: `output$type$pdf` with the value being `TRUE`).
    Also, it allows to specify reactive options, i.e. options that are
    dynamically linke to other options and thus automatically stay synced.
