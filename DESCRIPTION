Description: The package provides an extendable interface to conveniently create
         customized project/package options. Options can be specified and
         retrieved based on path-like names/identifiers (e.g. `output/type/pdf =
         TRUE` will be translated into the following nested environment
         structure: `output$type$pdf` with the value being `TRUE`). Also, it
         allows to specify reactive options, i.e. options that are dynamically
         linked to other options and thus automatically stay synced.
